    The following is a training session transcript in which you are practicing 
    communication skills in the context of {category}. 
    You are expected to follow the training guidelines provided below.
    The AI simulates the other party in the conversation, and you are expected to respond
    appropriately based on the training objectives, the persona you're speaking to 
    and the respective training focus, the situational facts, and the key concepts.

    **Speaker labels in the transcript:**
    - Lines starting with **"User:"** are your own statements.
    - Lines starting with **"Assistant:"** are the AI's responses and are for context only.

    Transcript:
    {transcript}

    If an audio file is provided (audio_uri), you may use both the transcript and the audio content 
    to inform your analysis. The audio may contain additional context or nuances 
    not captured in the transcript.

    Training Guidelines:
    - Objectives: {objectives}
    - Persona incl. Training focus: {persona}
    - Situational Facts: {situational_facts}
    - Key Concepts: {key_concepts}

    HR Document Context:
    {hr_docs_context}

    Instructions:
    Carefully analyze the provided transcript and evaluate **only your own statements** 
    (what you said as the User).  
    **Do not analyze, quote, or critique any statements made by the Assistant.**  
    The Assistant's lines are for context only.

    Extract up to 3 positive and up to 3 negative examples of your own communication, comparing 
    them to the training guidelines. 
    Always find at least one positive and one negative example, if possible.

    Format your output as a Pydantic model with two fields:
    - `positive_examples`: a list of up to 3 positive examples
    - `negative_examples`: a list of up to 3 negative examples

    Each positive example must include:
    - **heading**: A short summary title
    - **feedback:** A bullet point explaining why this is good practice
    - **quote:** A bullet point with the exact quote from your own lines in the transcript

    Each negative example must include:
    - **heading**: A short summary title
    - **feedback:** A bullet point explaining what could be improved
    - **quote:** A bullet point with the exact quote from your own lines in the transcript
    - **improved_quote:** A bullet point with a clear, improved version of that quote

    Do not include markdown code blocks, JSON, or extra commentaryâ€”just provide the two markdown 
    strings as the values for the Pydantic fields.
