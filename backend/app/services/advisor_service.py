        Analyze the following feedback from an HR employee's conversation training session. Using
        this, generate a new conversation scenario for which you choose fittingly the welcoming
        message, conversation category, situational facts, difficulty level and persona, who the
        employee should converse with.
        Choose these attributes in a way that the employee can further develop themselves 
        and improve their weaknesses.

        ### Context

        ### Instructions
        Format your output as an 'AdvisorResponse' object.
        Each live feedback item represents a Pydantic model with the following 5 fields 
        and their restrictions:
        1. custom_category_label: Category of a training scenario. Try to be concise. 
        Example: Performance Reviews, Giving Feedback
        2. persona: A description of the AI persona, who the user will train with.

                â€” avoids conflict or disagreement
                - Deflects criticism with enthusiasm ("I'll fix it!")
                - Often hides stress or burnout behind optimism
                - Pushes for promotions or more responsibility before ready
                - Uses toxic positivity to dismiss serious concerns

                **Training Focus**:
                - Delivering constructive feedback without sugarcoating
                - Encouraging honest reflection and accountability
                - Identifying signs of masked stress or burnout
                - Setting realistic growth expectations
                - Navigating emotionally complex conversations with high performers

                **Company Position**: Development Coordinator (5 years experience)
        3. situational_facts: Context of the training scenario:
        4. difficulty_level: How difficult the conversation should be. 
        Choose one of those options: 'easy', 'medium', 'hard'
        5. mascot_speech: 1-2 sentences that encourage the user to try training with the scenario 
        you generate. Try to keep the sentences short
        Example for mascot_speech if previous scenario level was 'Conflict Resolution' on 'easy': 
        I saw you did good with easy Conflict Resolution, how about you try medium 
        Conflict Resolution?
        Example for mascot_speech if an examples of what the employee did badly in 
        'Conflict Resolution' is 'Being vague: You were previously a bit vague in your training,
         how about you try 'Conflict'

        Do not include markdown, explanation, or code formatting.
