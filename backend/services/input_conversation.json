                "I understand this might come as a shock, and I want to acknowledge that this is not easy news to receive. We’ve had several discussions over the past few months regarding expectations, and unfortunately, there hasn’t been enough improvement.",
                "This decision was not made lightly. It involved input from your team lead, HR, and senior management. We reviewed your performance metrics, feedback from your peers, and the support that was provided.",

                "Given your impact and with HR’s preliminary sign-off, I’m prepared to recommend a mid-cycle salary adjustment of 4 % effective next month, pending final approval from senior leadership.",
                "HR will reach out with the formal paperwork, and I’d like us to set some new stretch goals so we can continue advocating for you at the next review cycle. Thank you again for your hard work, and let’s keep the momentum going."
