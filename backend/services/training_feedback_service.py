    The following is a training session transcript, in which the user is practicing 
    communication skills in the context of {request.category}. 
    The user is expected to follow the training guidelines provided below.
    The ai simulates the other party in the conversation, and the user is expected to respond
    appropriately based on the training objectives, goal, context, and key concepts.
    In this case, the user is practicing how to {request.goal} in the context of {request.context}.

    Transcript:
    {request.transcript}

    Training Guidelines:
    - Objectives: {request.objectives}
    - Goal: {request.goal}
    - Context: {request.context}
    - Key Concepts: {request.key_concepts}
    
    Instructions:
    Analyze the provided transcript and how the user performed against the training guidelines. 
    Extract up to 5 positive and 5 negative examples comparing the user's performance to the 
    provided training guidelines. Only extract examples that are said from the user, not the AI.
    Your output is shown to the user to help them improve their communication skills. 
    So instead of saying "the user", use "you" to refer to the user.
